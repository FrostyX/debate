- projects && sub-projects
- event-based rebuilds
- states finished/succeeded (createrepo)

    - pros - saved space in lookaside cache
    - cons
        - hacks in spec file, https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/science:unstable/FreeCAD/FreeCAD.spec?expand=1
        - or difficult setup, https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/home:praiskup:resalloc/resalloc/_service?expand=1

- webhooks
